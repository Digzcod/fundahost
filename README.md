I am using NextJS 15 with adapting react 19.
Working on local host or local machine because the other libraries instilled with ----legacy-peer-deps
Means all the libraries installed such as redux, formik, yup is working local machine mode 

# Note 2
But in production mode it would crush because of new existing of nextJS v15 with react new version 19^.
